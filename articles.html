<h3>Stronger Abs,Bigger Lifts!</h3>
<p>Summer is coming and the one thing on most peoples mind isn't corona virus its getting abs ASAP. The average joe might do crunches and sit ups everyday to get in shape, but unforutnately the results don't show in time.</p>
<p>There is a reason for this abs don't appear magically from from doing crunches! since the abs are also known as the core you have to build everything around your core to become stronger first, basically what im saying is start doing full bodywork outs</p>
<p>nutrition is also another key component in gaining the body you want. you can't eat Mcdonalds everyday and expect to get results, portion your calories and treat your body as a temple don't not, and i repeat don't not smoke or drink alcohol this will also stop you from your progress.</p>
